                <p>As a school project, my friend René de Waele and I decided to make a 3D animated movie about our class trip to the idyllic Dutch town of Valkenburg a/d Geul. Being quite new at it, and the deadline was within a few months we decided to keep it low-polygon. The result is a 20 minute long slapstick movie, a series of sketches that are mostly only funny if ‘you have been there’ or know who the jokes are about.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

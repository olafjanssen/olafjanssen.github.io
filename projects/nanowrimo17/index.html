                <p>On November 1, 2017 I saw a link to NaNoWriMo, or the National Novel Writing Month. The site is a platform that organizes the Month each year in November. The goal is simple: write a novel of at least 50,000 words to succeed. You can keep track of your daily word count on the site, but you have to enter it yourself. At the end, you submit your entire manuscript for an official word count.</p>
<p>I had several ideas for books. I have started with two of them. One is non-fiction, about writing your own personal bible, see project <a href="/projects/perbiblion">PerBiblion</a>. The other one is the one I am writing this month. I made several notes in the last few months about possible angles and perspectives for writing this book and because of that I made it very complex to the point that it was almost impossible to start writing. So I decided to do the following: I am writing a novel, with more or less the theme of the book I was preparing. And at the end I can see if it was what I had intended or if I can maybe rework it in a larger work or maybe it suffices to write a sequal.</p>
<p>My main concern is to keep up the work, because writing 1,600 words a day is not easy for me. If I want to write well, I choose my words carefully. Otherwise, the text will be chaotic, not quite unlike the content of most project descriptions on this site. However, if I choose to accept my writing style and just stop complaining, I might complete this work at the end of the month.

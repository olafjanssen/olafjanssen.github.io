<p>My handwriting has always been awful. Taking fast notes lead to disaster; writing in exams must have been a treat for my teachers. Luckily, boredom has come to my rescue. Between doodling, I found time to practice slow writing. Immediately patterns started to emerge in my handwriting that I have since then worked on. There are a few features important:</p>
<ul>
<li>excessive curliness and continuity within a character</li>
<li>abusing the resemblance to Greek letters such as the <em>small delta</em> for a <em>d</em> and the <em>nu</em> for <em>v</em></li>
<li>very long horizontal lines for the top of the <em>l</em> and the tails of the <em>g</em></li>
</ul>
<p>When I tried to make a font I had to take away those features, there is a project later on about creating the horizontal lines in a font. However, I still managed to capture the soul of my handwriting in this font. It is a lousy Bitmap font, so it scales horribly, there is not a single thought about kerning and the character thickness goes all over the place. However, this is how I made it in 2002, without any knowledge about fonts. Try it out by <a href="/fonts/pudgcom.ttf">downloading</a> it. Or check out the sample text below.</p>
<h2 id="sample-text">Sample text</h2>
<p><span class="pudgcom">Dear reader!</span></p>
<p><span class="pudgcom">So, I suppose this is how I wrote when I was about 20 years old. Do you like what you see? I am afraid it is even more extravagant now.</span></p>
<p><span class="pudgcom">Dutch words I liked to practice on were: vliegtuig and waterschade.</span></p>
<p><span class="pudgcom">Yours forever,<br> Olaf Janssen</span></p>

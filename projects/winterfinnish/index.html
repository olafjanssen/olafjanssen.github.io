                <p>When you spend some time riding the bus, at one point, you may end up knowing Finnish. The language has always tickled a soft spot for me. The combination of vowel harmony, cold regularity and pronunciation, the mythical elements and the grammar that is not quite like other languages.</p>
<p>To my dismay, there was no major app to learn Finnish other than a few simple travel-phrase based apps. I wanted something comprehensive and user friendly like DuoLingo. When I found WordDive, I was enthusiastic. Especially because they claim to use AI and are really Finnish based.</p>
<h1 id="results">Results</h1>
<p>I started somewhere at the end of December 2017. Now that the winter is over, it is time to tally up the results.</p>
<p>That is:</p>
<ul>
<li>finished the Advanced level course</li>
<li><strong>3,012 items</strong> permanently learned between week 51 of 2017 until week 10 of 2018 spending 90 hours on it</li>
<li>on average <strong>35 items per day</strong>, <strong>64 minutes per day</strong> (where did I find the time)</li>
<li>about <strong>108 seconds</strong> to learn a new item permanently</li>
</ul>
<p>According to the WordDive site I have now reached the following level:
    <strong>Chief (B2.2)</strong> You interact with a degree of fluency and can discuss even complex topics.</p>

<h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
<p>To be honest, I don&#39;t think those 3,012 items are really permanent as I&#39;ve forgotten many of the old ones in a simple test. So I guess I will have to practice them a bit more. Moreover, I have basically only practices isolated words actively. All the words are used in a sentence in the app but then I only learn sentences passively. There are a few grammar-based modules but not really in depth. So in conclusion. I feel good about myself but I can&#39;t speak any Finnish if my life depended on it.</p>

Caffeine appeared to have a bigger impact on my life than I expected. Follow how I went from 10 cups a day to 0 and the impact on my health, sensitivity and axiety. Do you think you are immune to the effects of caffeine? Maybe you consider yourself an evening person? Why not go into caffeine rehab and see if you are truly not sensitive to coffee.

* August 1998*
A 2D game I wrote in Pascal using Assembler for the VGA graphics. You shoot missiles that are attracted by the gravity of multiple planets. It can be seen as the forerunner of Angry Birds Space, but without birds and with a background story packed with 90ies nostalgia events.

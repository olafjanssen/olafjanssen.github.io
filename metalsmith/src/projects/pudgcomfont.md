<style>
@font-face {
 font-family: "Pudgcom";
 src: url("/fonts/pudgcom.ttf");
}

.pudgcom {
    font-family: "Pudgcom";
    word-spacing: 0.5em;
    font-size: 1.25em;
}
</style>

My handwriting has always been awful. Taking fast notes lead to disaster; writing in exams must have been a treat for my teachers. Luckily, boredom has come to my rescue. Between doodling, I found time to practice slow writing. Immediately patterns started to emerge in my handwriting that I have since then worked on. There are a few features important:

* excessive curliness and continuity within a character
* abusing the resemblance to Greek letters such as the *small delta* for a *d* and the *nu* for *v*
* very long horizontal lines for the top of the *l* and the tails of the *g*

When I tried to make a font I had to take away those features, there is a project later on about creating the horizontal lines in a font. However, I still managed to capture the soul of my handwriting in this font. It is a lousy Bitmap font, so it scales horribly, there is not a single thought about kerning and the character thickness goes all over the place. However, this is how I made it in 2002, without any knowledge about fonts. Try it out by [downloading](/fonts/pudgcom.ttf) it. Or check out the sample text below.

## Sample text

<span class="pudgcom">Dear reader!</span>

<span class="pudgcom">So, I suppose this is how I wrote when I was about 20 years old. Do you like what you see? I am afraid it is even more extravagant now.</span>

<span class="pudgcom">Dutch words I liked to practice on were: vliegtuig and waterschade.</span>

<span class="pudgcom">Yours forever,<br> Olaf Janssen</span>

description: I created Sitelen Sitelen Renderer because I am fascinated by combining the artifical minimal language Toki Pona with the non-linear writing style 'Sitelen Sitelen' by Jonathan Gabel. Unlike other work with Sitelen Sitelen I want the writings to be generated by the computer. I set out to create SVG-only sitelen sitelen that can be exported and reused.

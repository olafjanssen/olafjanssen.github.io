## Inspiration
Everyone has features that are a perfect breeding ground for insecurities or low self-image. Many artists have taken their special feature as inspiration for cartoons. For instace [Tall & Curly](https://www.facebook.com/tallncurlycomics/) about a (relatively) tall girl with huge curly hair, or [Busty Girl Comics](http://bustygirlcomics.com/) about girls with huge boobies. In my case, my tallness puts me in plenty of awkward positions, sometimes literally. So I decided to do a series of cartoons on the topic.

I have collected the cartoons also in the [Flurry Flakes Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/FlurryFlakes/).

## The cartoons

## Reflection
While it was fun to do, freestyle drawing on an iPad remains frustrating to do, I just can't get the same feel as with pencil on paper and the results aren't great. I'm still struggling with being tall so I should probably keep adding more cartoons to it for it to stay cathartic.

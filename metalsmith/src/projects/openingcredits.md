Any movie and computer game is introduced by one or several short animations to introduce the several production companies involved with the product. In a mood of wanting to test as much special effects as possible with the animation package that I was using at the moment, I decided to make these opening credits for Pudgcom Entertainment. The theme of this small clip is ‘mayhem’. While the latest modeling applications have almost unlimited possibilities I am, of course, pondering on a new version.

## Features
* A wide range of modeling effects such as clay-balls and puzzle-like decomposition, aided by animated textures.
* Postproduction effects including particles, lens flares and glows.
* Catchy (copyrighted) music by Suicidal Tendencies. 

## The result

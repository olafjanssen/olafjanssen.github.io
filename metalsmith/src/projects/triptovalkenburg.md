description: A 20 minute 3D slapstick adventure movie created with 3D Studio v4 and with the help of two classmates. It retells the tale of our school outing to the pastoral village of Valkenburg. Considering it to be our first steps into 3D modelling and with the limited time and resources (none), it was quite a feat.

After designing a fake logo for a fake herbs & spices shop called Red Pepper, I created a dancing logo by merging multiple frames into an animated GIF. GIFs are only cool for movie related memes and I wanted to save my logo as an SVG instead. The next brilliant idea was to write a JavaScript snippet or micro library to make this logo and any other logo or SVG dance to James Last music! The world will never be the same. The final result is very similar to my GIF in the previous post, but now itâ€™s all SVG enhanced by funkySVG!

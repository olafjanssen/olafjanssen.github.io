## The Report
I used and bugfixed a 3D FEM model for optical simulations written in FORTAN. Most scripting was done with Matlab. Read the full [report.pdf](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0hxo94mlc2f2k5z/otajanssen_master_plasmons.pdf?dl=0).

## Abstract
Using a finite element model, the characteristics of surface plasmons and enhanced transmission are investigated on 2D metal films with one slit, two slits and more slits. The effects of surface plasmons and waveguide resonances on the transmission are identified. A groove grating is proposed which captures perpendicular incident light and effectively couples it to transmission at a single slit. Its transmission increases when more grooves are added. The results can
be of great importance for near-field optical applications.

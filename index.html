        <p class="project-full-blurp">I decided to participate in the National Writing Month (NaNoWriMo) to write a 50,000 word novel in the month November. That means just over 1,600 words a day. I will tell the story of a man that uncovers the mysteries of the Ponas, a people speaking their peculiar language Toki Pona.

        <p class="project-full-blurp">Puzzle Square is a children&#x27;s game written in pure JavaScript for tablet devices to practice with touch drag and drop. It is inspired by the Israeli board game Ma BaMishbetzet in which you fill a matrix based on for instance the shape (columns) and color (rows) with picture cards.
